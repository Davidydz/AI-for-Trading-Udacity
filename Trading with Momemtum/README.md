# Project Overview
In this project, You will apply the momemtum trading algorithm on a universe of stocks and time range. I will first compute the signal for the time range given and then apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, I will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, I will be using the end of day from Quotemedia.
